## Anti-AI Slop Enforcement

---

# 1. LAYOUT ENFORCEMENT

Homepage must NOT:

- Be a centered card
- Use full-width hero with large paragraph and CTA
- Look like a SaaS landing page
- Be symmetrical in a predictable 3-column grid

Instead:

- Use asymmetric layout where appropriate
- Use system framing elements
- Make navigation feel embedded in OS

---

# 2. SPACING ENFORCEMENT

Do NOT use excessive whitespace.

Spacing must feel intentional and structured.

Prefer:
- 8px / 12px / 16px / 24px system
Avoid:
- Random large gaps

---

# 3. COLOR ENFORCEMENT

Accent color must feel:

Sharp.
High contrast.
Purposeful.

If accent appears everywhere → reduce it.

Magenta must never overpower cyan.

---

# 4. CARD ENFORCEMENT

TerminalCard must:

- Have window controls
- Have thin border
- Have metadata section
- Have hover border transition

If card looks like generic Tailwind card → redesign.

---

# 5. NAVIGATION ENFORCEMENT

Navigation must feel like system bar.

Include:
SYSTEM_STATUS indicator.

If nav looks like:
Logo + 4 links + CTA button
→ It fails.

---

# 6. ATMOSPHERE ENFORCEMENT

The site must feel:

Operational.
Running.
Alive.

Not:
Friendly.
Corporate.
Playful.
Startup-like.

---

# 7. UNIQUENESS TEST

Ask internally:

“Would this look at home in a futuristic dev OS?”

If not → redesign.
